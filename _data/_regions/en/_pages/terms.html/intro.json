WE RESERVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT LIABILITY TO RESTRICT OR REFUSE ACCESS TO THE SITE AND ITS SERVICES, CONTENT, MATERIALS AND FUNCTIONS TO ANYBODY. WE FURTHER RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK ANY FORM OF RELIEF, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ATTORNEYS' FEES, RELATED TO FRAUDULENT OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE SITE.<br /><br />Because we are not involved in the actual transaction between buyers and suppliers, if applicable, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, you also on behalf of yourself, your predecessors, if applicable, and each of their present and former officers, employees, directors, shareholders, parents, subsidiaries, alter egos, affiliates, partners, agents, attorneys, accountants, heirs, executors, administrators, conservators, successors and assigns, as applicable, hereby fully and forever releases and discharges the Indemnified Parties, from any and all claims, demands, liens, actions, agreements, suits, causes of action, obligations, controversies, debts, costs, attorneys' fees, expenses, damages, judgments, orders and liabilities of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or suspected which have existed or may have existed, or which do exist or which hereafter can, shall or may exist, based on any facts, events or omissions occurring from any time on or prior to the execution of this Agreement which arise out of, concern, pertain or relate in any way to this Agreement or the Site. You also acknowledge that there is a possibility that subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, you will discover facts or incur or suffer claims which were unknown or unsuspected at the time this Agreement was executed, and which if known by it at that time may have materially affected its decision to execute this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that by reason of this Agreement, and the release contained in this section of this Agreement, you are assuming any risk of such unknown facts and such unknown and unsuspected claims. You have been advised of the existence of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code (\"Section 1542\"), which provides:<br /><br />A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.<br /><br />Notwithstanding such provisions, this release shall constitute a full release in accordance with its terms. You knowingly and voluntarily waive the provisions of Section 1542, as well as any other statute, law or rule of similar effect. In connection with such waiver and relinquishment, you acknowledge that you are aware that you may hereafter discover claims presently unknown or unsuspected, or facts in addition to or different from those which you now know or believe to be true, with respect to the matters released herein. Nevertheless, it is your intention, through this Agreement, and with the advice of counsel, fully and finally settle and release all such matters, and all claims relative thereto, which do now exist, may exist, or have existed between and among the parties hereto, including the Indemnified Parties. You hereby acknowledge that you have been advised by your legal counsel, understand and acknowledge the significance and consequence of this release and of this specific waiver of Section 1542 and other such laws.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Indemnity</strong>. Except to the extent prohibited under applicable law: you agree to defend, indemnify and hold Dream and our hotels and each of our and their owners, partners, subsidiaries, affiliates, franchisees and each of such person's or entities' officers, directors, agents, contractors, subcontractors, guests, residents, visitors, licensees, invitees, permittees and employees (collectively, the \"Indemnified Parties\") harmless from and against any and all allegations, demands, claims, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties or costs of whatsoever nature (including reasonable attorneys' fees) and whether by reason of death of or injury to any person or loss of or damage to any property or otherwise (\"Claims\") arising out of or in any way connected with this Agreement, the services or products provided to you by the Site or any related act or failure to act by you and whether or not occasioned or contributed to by the negligence of Dream or any agent or employee of the Indemnified Parties or any of them (except as and to the extent prohibited by applicable law) or Claims arising from your account, including, without limitation, any Claims related to infringement by you of the intellectual property rights of any person, including without limitation, copyright, patent, trade secret, trade mark, artist rights, droit moral, privacy, publicity or rights under other intellectual property laws. In the event that any Claim is made or any action or proceeding is brought against the Indemnified Parties, or any of them, arising out of or connected with this Agreement, any such Indemnified Party may, by reasonable notice to you, require you, at your expense, to resist such Claim or take over the defense of any such action or proceeding and employ counsel for such purpose, such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of such Indemnified Party, which approval shall be deemed to have been given hereby in the case of counsel acting for your insurance underwriters engaged in such resistance or defense. You shall cooperate with us in the defense of any Claim. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Arbitration.</strong><br /><br /><em>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<em><br /><br />This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without regard to its principles of conflicts of law, and regardless of your location. If for any reason the arbitration provisions set forth below are found by a court of law to be unenforceable, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, NY, United States of America, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. You hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY NOW HAVE OR HEREAFTER POSSESS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent that applicable law in your country of residence requires application of another law and/or jurisdiction and this cannot be excluded by contract.<br /><br /><em>Arbitration</em><br /><br />Except with respect to any claim or dispute involving the ownership, validity or use of any Dream trademarks or service marks, any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or documents, data, information and other materials contained on the Site (&ldquo;Materials&rdquo;) (including any claim that any provision of this Agreement or Materials are invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void), seeking as relief money damages and/or attorneys&rsquo; fees or other damages will be submitted for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Dream shall have the right in a proper case to obtain temporary restraining orders, temporary or preliminary injunctive relief and/or declaratory relief (other than declarations with respect to the amount of money damages) from a court of competent jurisdiction.<br /><br />The arbitration proceedings shall be heard by one independent arbitrator who shall be an attorney or retired judge. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York and in accordance with the then-existing Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA. All matters within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1, et seq.) will be governed by it and not by any state arbitration law. You and Dream waive any rights to maintain other available resolution processes for such disputes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle disputes. You and Dream waive any right to a jury trial for such disputes. The rules in arbitration are different from the rules that apply in court. There is no judge or jury, and review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the Agreement, as a court would.<br /><br />In reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and Materials, shall be bound to apply the applicable law and shall not rule inconsistently with the applicable law. The arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis, and not as a consolidated, common, representative, group or class. The arbitrator shall include in his or her award any relief he or she deems proper in terms of money damages (with interest on unpaid amounts from the date due at the maximum rate allowed by law), and attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs. The award of the arbitrator shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto and judgment upon the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br /><br />Confidential. Other than as may be required by law, the entire arbitration proceedings (including, but not limited to, any rulings, decisions or orders of the arbitrator), shall remain confidential and not be disclosed to anyone other than the parties to this Agreement.<br /><br />Limitations Period. Any and all claims and actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Materials shall be commenced within one (1) year from the occurrence of the facts giving rise to such claim or action, or such claim or action shall be barred. This Limitations Period section does not apply to residents of New Jersey.<br /><br />Class Action Waiver. All disputes which cannot be resolved between the parties, and causes of action arising out of or connected with the Site, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action. You agree that you will not file a class action against Dream, or participate in a class action against Dream. You agree that you will not file or seek a class arbitration, or participate in a class arbitration, against Dream.<br /><br /><em>Severability</em><br /><br />If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except as otherwise set forth herein. No waiver of any term, provision or condition of this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other term, provision or condition hereof, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver of any such term, provision or condition hereof. No waiver shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.<br /><br /></em></em></li>\n<li><strong>Copyright Infringement Claims.</strong><br /><br />The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.
