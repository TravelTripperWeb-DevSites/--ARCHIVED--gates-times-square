We want you to be confident using this website and those of our brands and properties to choose your next hotel stay or begin a partnership with us.</p>\n<p>We are committed to protecting personal data that we collect through websites we own or control from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (&ldquo;<strong>Websites</strong>&rdquo;), software applications we make available on or through mobile devices or computers (&ldquo;<strong>Apps</strong>&rdquo;), wireless/wi-fi connectivity that may be offered at our properties (&ldquo;<strong>Wi-Fi Access</strong>&rdquo;), social media channels that we control (&ldquo;<strong>Social Media Channels</strong>,&rdquo;) and booking/reservations services we control (collectively with Websites, Wi-Fi Access and Apps, the &ldquo;<strong>Services</strong>&rdquo;) that link to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes our global practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of data about identified or identifiable individuals through the Services (&ldquo;<strong>Personal Data</strong>&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Dream is the data controller of the Personal Data collected, and is responsible for the processing of the Personal Data.</p>\n<p>If you are providing information through the Services on behalf of someone else (e.g., your customer, client, employee, family member, or friend) you hereby represent that you have the right to do so and that you have provided such party with a copy of this Privacy Policy, and all references to &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo; data or Personal Data herein refers to the data or information of both you and such individual, as applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>By using the Services, you acknowledge, understand and agree to the policies and practices contained in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overview <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Information Collected <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Use of Collected Information <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Sharing of Collected Information <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Retention of Collected Information <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Security of Collected Information <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Your Rights Regarding Personal Data <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Links to Third-Party Websites and Services <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Children <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Email, Opt-Out, and Marketing Communications<br /><br /></li>\n<li>International Use <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Changes to our Privacy Policy <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Applicability of this Privacy Policy <br /><br /></li>\n<li>Contacting Us</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"h4\">Information Collected</p>\n<p>We collect a variety of Personal Data from you through the Services. Some Personal Data is collected automatically when you use or browse the Services, while other data is only collected when you provide it to us directly.</p>\n<p>As a result, you have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide data, you may decline; but if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a service or feature, you may not be able to use that service or feature. For example, you may choose to create a Dream account when you reserve a room through our Services, which creates a smoother future booking process but requires submitting additional information. You may also choose to submit social media content through our Services, in which case we collect certain information associated with that social media account such as account name, the shared content, and any comments or interactions with the shared content.</p>\n<p>Dream collects the following types of Personal Data through the Services:</p>\n<p><span>Information Collected Automatically</span>. When you download and/or use an App or browse a Website, we collect information about your device and the network you use to access the Services, as well as information about your use of the Services. This includes without limitation software and hardware attributes of the device used, unique device ID information (such as unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers for smartphones), regional and language settings, network provider, and IP address, as well as Service performance data, dates and times that you use the Services, the amount of time spent on specific pages or in specific channels, and other similar usage information.</p>\n<p><span>Location Information</span>. We may also collect location information through certain Services, depending on the Services you use and/or the permissions you provide. &ldquo;Precise&rdquo; location information may be derived from sources including without limitation your device&rsquo;s GPS and location systems, as well as nearby wi-fi networks and cell phone towers. Imprecise location information may include without limitation your IP address or other data that may identify you as being located in a specific region, city, or postal code. You can manage the Services&rsquo; ability to track your location by allowing or disallowing that access for a given Service in your computer or mobile device&rsquo;s settings.</p>\n<p><span>Other Information You Provide To Us</span>. We collect Personal Data from you when you provide it to us, which may include, without limitation, to provide you with information or to provide you with services that you request (including bookings), to carry out a transaction or reservation, to create a Dream account, to respond to an inquiry, when you submit social media content to us or interact with a Social Media Channel, when you respond to a customer survey, or when you apply for a position with us. Depending on the Services used or the products or information requested, the information collected from you may include without limitation your name, telephone number, email address, account information, street address, billing and payment information, region, travel plans, travel status, order or service history, hotel guest stay preferences, use of hotel amenities, information that you provide about children who accompany you, social media account information (such as account or handle, number of followers, social media profile), loyalty or rewards program numbers, or (if you&rsquo;re applying for a position with us) employment-related information, as well as any additional information that you choose to enter into text fields, &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; forms, RFP forms, or that you provide to our customer service representatives.</p>\n<p><span>Information from Third Parties</span>. We also collect or receive Personal Data from third parties who submit information on your behalf, vendors and service providers that we have engaged to provide services to us or to you (&ldquo;Providers&rdquo;), as well as from Providers that provide web analytics and usage information to us (such as Google Analytics). For example, if you reserve a room through a channel manager, travel agency, booking service (such as SynXis), or event or conference promoter, we collect certain information from that third party as required to effectuate and authenticate the reservation. If you interact with a Social Media Channel or submit social media content to us, we receive certain data from the applicable social media platform and we may collect certain information from the social media account you use to interact with us, including the name associated with the account, the account handle, recent activity, the content of any posts in which we are tagged, and other information that may be contained on your social media profile to allow us to respond to the posts and understand and engage with our audience. Depending on the type of information and the context in which it is used, the foregoing information may be associated with data we collect from you directly, have obtained from other sources, or have previously retained within a given user account.</p>\n<p>Finally, we may collect data that is not Personal Data. We may use and distribute any such data at our discretion, unless it is combined with Personal Data, in which case we will treat it as Personal Data subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p class=\"h4\">Use of Collected Information</p>\n<p>We process Personal Data for, or based on, one or more of the following legal bases:</p>\n<p><span>Performance of a Contract</span>.

We use Personal Data to protect ourselves and our employees, Guests and Clients, as well as any Providers, and others. This includes authenticating user activity; enforcing our &ldquo;<strong>Terms of Use&lt;</strong>&rdquo; and the terms of use of our Providers; and monitoring and preventing fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity. In addition, we use and disclose Personal Data to the extent we deem necessary to protect the rights, property, safety, operations, and privacy of Dream and its Guests and Clients, personnel, Providers, affiliates, or others and as we deem necessary to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules, and requests of law enforcement and/or other governmental agencies.</p>\n<p><span>Employment or other Engagement</span>. If you are applying for a position, we use Personal Data to process and evaluate your application and, if you are engaged, in connection with your engagement.</p>\n<p>When information is collected from you, the description of how we will use the Personal Data will be available to you at the time of collection through this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p class=\"h4\">Sharing of Collected Information</p>\n<p>Some of the above uses involve sharing collected Personal Data with third parties. We share Personal Data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or as necessary to provide any services you have requested or authorized or as permitted or required by law.</p>\n<p>We share Personal Data for a variety of purposes, including for provision of our services such as reservations, guest communications and concierge services, marketing our products and services, payment processing and other financial services, fraud prevention, and risk mitigation/reduction. For example, when you make a reservation through a Provider&rsquo;s service, we may share certain Personal Data with the Provider to authenticate you. In addition, some of our operations, such as reservation services, may be operated using Providers&rsquo; systems, and as such the Providers will be directly collecting your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>We also share Personal Data with Providers who need the information to provide services to you or to us, but only to the extent the information is needed to provide such services. This includes: software and web developers, payment processors, online travel agencies and channel managers, booking and reservations managers, maintenance companies, Guest and Client benefits providers, email and other marketing vendors, marketing technology vendors, and Providers we have retained to assist in securing our systems. We also use analytics Providers and software to assist us in understanding how our Guests and Clients use the Services and our systems. For more information on how we collect information for analytics, see &ldquo;<strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>&rdquo; below.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may disclose information we maintain, including Personal Data, when permitted or required to do so by law; in response to a request from a law enforcement agency or authority or any regulatory authority; and/or to protect the integrity of the Services or our interests, rights, property, or safety, and/or that of our users, Providers, and others.</p>\n<p>We do not share, sell, or lease Personal Data about you to any third parties for their marketing use. We will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, as noted above, to protect your account from fraud, to enforce our &ldquo;<strong>Terms of Use</strong>&rdquo; and the terms of use of our Providers, or as we reasonably deem necessary to respond to requests from government agencies or law enforcement).</p>\n<p>In addition, if all or a part of Dream is sold or management is transferred to another entity, we may transfer, disclose, or replicate some or all of the Personal Data we have to potential or actual third-party acquirers.</p>\n<p class=\"h4\">Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</p>\n<p><span>Cookies</span>.
