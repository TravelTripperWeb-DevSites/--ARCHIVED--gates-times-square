The presentation is spectacular, and the service is second to none.  The staff treats each customer like a VIP!  Would highly, highly recommend.  The experience is one that you will never forget!  Le Bernardin has set the bar so high that no other restaurant in the world that I've dined in even comes close.  It is well-deserving of its 3 Michelin stars.",
