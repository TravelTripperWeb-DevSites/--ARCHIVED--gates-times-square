This is a beautiful library building with tons of marble, just a few steps away from Grand Central Station. If you are visiting the area and would like to do research in the library, you can apply for a library card on-line. Please note, if you are carrying luggage you will not be allowed in the building.

For tourists, there’s a lot of beautiful floors and marble pillars, great photo opportunities, old paintings, and just very cool long old halls. For those more initiated (which I am not), there’s lots of history here, and thousands and thousands of books. It’s a functioning library too, so you can ask the librarians for help researching things. They have extensive records and statistic books there. Either way, an amazing place to visit. Can see it in about 30 minutes if you’re in a rush.",

I wasn't even brave enough to snap a pic fearing that it would create unwanted noise. Its impressive. For the crowd adverse, they offer even more intimate reading rooms which provide a much needed separation (and Wifi) from the crowds. \n\nThe featured exhibits are impressive. The original Winnie the Pooh collection is notable. Some people write that its awkward to go without kids but I don't think it's so.\n\nIts directly behind Bryant Park; with various food options, this is a fantastic afternoon adventure and worth the trip.\n\nTip: You can take a book to the patio and enjoy a read by the park.",
