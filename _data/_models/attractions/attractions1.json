We were there because we were seeing a matinee performance of “Hello Dolly” with Bernadette Peters. The reason I’m writing this review though, is because I had the best Bloody Mary ever here. Hands down. It was perfect. One of those cocktail moments you have every once in a while. I haven’t been back since but I think about it a lot. lol. I won’t bother to describe it my vocabulary is limited. Stop by for brunch and see for yourself",

          "text": "A waste of $300.  They are more interested in beefing up your bill than service. \n\nI was excited when we entered.   I felt like we stepped back in time.  Took a bit of time to get service, but when he came, the waiter seemed nice.   He asked if we wanted bubbly or still water - guess tap was not an option - so he delivered a $20 bottle of still water. Not the end of the world.  \n\nWe had the squash coated shrimp and heirloom tomato appetizers.   Both were great. A surprise combination of flavors that worked very well together on each plate.  We were feeling good and looking forward to dinner.  \n\nWe ordered the recommendations from the waiter.  I had the Peking duck and hubby ordered the salmon.  The waiter asked him what side he wanted - like his fish came without anything - so he ordered the spinach.  When the meals came they were disappointing.   The salmon was too rich and almost raw and the skin was not crispy.  And, it came on a wonderful bed of vegetables so we barely touched the $14 spinach.  My duck was done great but soon the sweetness became too much.  Something fresh and bright on the plate would have been good.  \n\nWe had to flag someone down to refill hubby’s iced tea, but they were quick to offer another $25 glass of wine.  \n\nFor dessert my husband ordered the peach cobbler.  When it arrived it was not hot and the peaches were not cooked through.   After we finally found someone to complain to, our waiter suggested the lemon cake.  He commented on the size as he sat it down as it was huge.   Taste was great but too much for husband to eat, even with my help.  When we got the bill I was surprised to see a $30 charge - for two desserts as I did not order one.  The waiter said all the desserts were served in portions for two.  I guess we missed that on the menu.  The truth is, a classy place would have comped the second dessert since the first one was not cooked.  \n\nBottom line is that we spent over $300 for a meal that was disappointing, as was the service.  I guess that is why the restaurant was almost empty when we left on a Friday night at 7:30 pm.",
