          "text": "Alright, I’m going to kick it off by saying that this hotel, is absolutely the worst hotel I have been too—if anything, it is the worst hotel! Do not get me wrong, yes it is affordable and the location is great, however, you could do a lot with the money they take from you. I have been to a plethora of different hotels and this is truly the worst for families, couples, and more. It is too small and too dirty. The staff are extremely rude and demeaning—they belittle you and completely ignore you. They steal your things and don’t clean whatsoever. They stole my room keys so I had to pay $500. Before I checked out, I left the keys in the room, I quickly realized and rushed back within the two minutes I left the room. The guy and lady was “cleaning” it. I ran in and checked everywhere—nothing was clean, they were standing by the wall, looking careless, but they had that energy that they were hiding something. They additionally try to steal over $60 while they were cleaning! I actually saw it with my own eyes, the guy was cleaning the room and I was standing outside. I left my wallet and I saw the guy literally put his hands in my wallet and pull it out! I rushed over and snatched it away before walking out. In addition, they refuse to clean my family’s room for two whole days! They gave us not enough towels and extremely dirty towels! WHO GIVES A PERSON A TOWEL WITH FECAL MATTER ON IT? I told everything to the front desk and they did not care whatsoever. The view is horrible and the noise is extreme. Our hotel room was next to a crack alley. I was extremely disappointed and I never felt so disgusted. I know for a fact New York isn’t a horrible place, but that hotel gives it a bad reputation. Do not go to that hotel, whatever you do, DO NOT EVER GO TO THIS HOTEL.",

Don't bother booking a room with a view, because as the check-in host put it \"there are no real views of the city; you just get to see more of the street instead of the side of another building.\" It was clean and modern, but extremely noisy (they even provide free ear plugs for you to sleep with); comparatively we have stayed a hotels just a block over and have no problem with the street noise. The elevators are slow and fit only about two/ three people. Over all decent hotel. Not bad, but probably wouldn't book again as there are nicer hotels in the same area and price point.",
