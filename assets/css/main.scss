This is initially set up to first pull in a custom varaibles file, then pull in the themeable components of ZOM css and then pull in any custom css for this project.

If a large number of SASS includes are required for this project, consider using the alternative setup:
1. Remove this /assets/css/main.scss file completely
2. Modify /_sass/all.scss to include whatever additional components you need
3. Run sass manually e.g. via sass --watch _sass/all.scss:assets/css/main.css  --style compressed
4. Commit /assets/css/main.css to the repository
TODO: update the comman line option in step3 above?
